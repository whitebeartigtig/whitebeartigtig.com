	    <p>Ariara Island (Philippines)</p>
	    <p>I did some research on private islands and found this </p>

	    <p>My Island</p>
	    <p><img src="img/SCR-20240909-jwit-2.jpeg" width="800" alt=""/></p>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p>Setup</p>
	    <p>Here is Unity Hub. I have already signed in wiht my account. This is where a list of projects are and where you can manage your Unity installs in the case that you have more than one version of Unity installled on your machine.</p>
	    <p>On a new user account you may need to locate the existing install location, but since I use my personal machine, it was already here.</p>
	    <p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-lath.png" width="600" height="370" alt=""/></p>
	    <p>To create a new project, you can click on the big blue &quot;New project&quot; button. This window will pop up, you can select your editor version here (in this case 2022.3.44f1), select &quot;3D (Built-In Render Pipeline), name the project and then press on &quot;Create project&quot;.</p>
	    <p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-laxq.png" width="600" height="370" alt=""/></p>
	    <p>The next step is importing any assets we may use. In this case we have some sample assets. You can simply import them by dragging the folder into the Project window.</p>
	    <p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-lbfp.png" width="600" height="189" alt=""/></p>
	    <p>I will also take the time to mention the Hierarchy window, this is where all of the objects in your current scene are located. By default there will be the &quot;Main Camera&quot; and a &quot;Directional Light&quot;.</p>
	    <p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-lbio.png" width="223" height="400" alt=""/></p>
	    <p>Now that we've got the project created and assets imported, we can create a new Terrain by going to GameObject &gt; Terrain.</p>
	    <div class="row">
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-kqvf.png" width="400" height="282" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Right now it is just flat, so to change that you go under the Inspector widget and select Raise or Lower Terrain.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-kqzc-2.png" width="400" height="324" alt=""/></p>
		<p>With the terrain object selected, you can now draw the terrain in, Holding down the left click button for longer will make it taller. To make it smaller, you can hold shift and do the same thing.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-krgu-2.png" width="600" height="259" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Smooth Height does just about what you would expect, it smoothes out the terrain. It is most effective on the jagged edges that sometimes arrise.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-ksxk-2.png" width="600" height="243" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Set height allows you to set a maximum height, and it will never go above the height entered.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-ktad-2.png" width="600" height="253" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Next up is adding textures. Go to paint textures, Create Layer and then </p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240910-kusc-2.png" width="400" height="156" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Rain Effect</p>
		<p>This can be added to the scene and it will add a rain particle effect. This is simply an asset that another person has made.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jcnh.png" width="400" height="245" alt=""/></p>
		<p>The rain effect can be controlled by opening un the heirarchy and modifying the properties in Inspector.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jpgo.jpeg" width="900" height="316" alt=""/></p>
		<p>You can add normal and mask maps to a texture which makes them look less flat.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jivl.png" width="429" height="256" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jhjr.jpeg" width="400" height="256" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Creating a sun and atmosphere</p>
		<p>First create a new material by right clicking in assets, Create &gt; Material.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jlek.png" width="400" height="577" alt=""/> </p>
		<p>Now go into the Lighting window (if hidden enable it under the Window titlebar item) and drag the material onto skybox. Then add the Procedural shader.		</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jlzc.png" width="421" height="426" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jlvt.png" width="400" height="426" alt=""/></p>
		<p>A quick explaination of what these settings do will be needed:</p>
		<p>Sun Size controls the size of the sun.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Skybox</p>
		<p>To create a skybox, we need to make a new photoshop file with the dimensions of 8192x6144 at 100 pixels per centimeter. Then we can paste the image in and crop it so it fits perfectly.		</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-ktco.jpeg" width="528" height="301" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jssw.jpeg" width="400" height="301" alt=""/></p>
		<div class="row">
		  <p>We can then create a rectangle with the dimensions of 2048x2048, and paste that 6 times, and position them.</p>
		</div>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jtpu.jpeg" width="400" height="237" alt=""/></p>
		<p>After that we need to offset the image itself to make a seamless image. Go to Filter &gt; Other &gt; Offset.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240916-jwxb.jpeg" width="400" height="396" alt=""/></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For this next part, we have taken a hdri from an external website and put it into Unity. It is this exact one: https://ambientcg.com/view?id=NightSkyHDRI007</p>
		<p>I chose the 16K HDR version, but you can go with any of them. Here I have applied it and pointed the camera up at the sky.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-kwyl.png" width="800" height="441" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240917-kxsk.png" width="315" height="441" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Clouds</p>
		<p>It is possible to add Dynamic Clouds to the environment. They are split into Lower and Higher. The speed and density can be controlled individually.</p>
		<p><img src="img/SCR-20240917-lhci.jpeg" width="800" height="408" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Here is a video showing the clouds and rain in action, along with the first person controller. This was recorded using OBS Studio.</p>

        <p>Sound Effects + Music</p>
        <p>You can add sound effects and music by adding an audio source object and simply selecting the sound effect or music file in the &quot;AudioClip&quot; parameter in the Inspector.</p>
        <p><img src="img/SCR-20240923-jrsr.png" width="800" height="334" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Example        </p>
        <p>https://youtu.be/WlN90E4St2c</p>
        <p>Respawn Point</p>
        <p>The player respawns when it collides with the base object, which has a script applied to it to detect when the player collides with it and to send it back to a respawn point. Below is a demo of this working and a short video on how to do it. </p>

        <p>Post Processing</p>
        <p><img src="img/SCR-20240924-lxct.png" width="800" height="551" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Post Processing works about the same way you'd expect it to work in photo editing software. To use this you will need to install Post Processing from the package manager, and then apply a Post-process Layer and Post-process Volume. In the Post-process Volume, you can add various effects such as Bloom, Colour Grading, Depth of Field, etc. These can all contribute to making the game look much better.</p>
        <p>Mini Game 1</p>
        <p>Planning</p>
        <p><img src="../../../MiniGame1Plan.jpeg" width="800" height="605" alt=""/></p>
        <p>I planned out a mini game to make within an hour, it was mostly successful, but animating all of those platforms took too long, so I didn't complete it. Given an extra 15-20 mins I believe I could complete the rest of this game, as all that needs to be done now is add in the checkpoints and play test it.</p>
        <p>Animation Potential</p>
        <p>Right now, the animations simply move side to side, and the player just needs to jump onto them. They make it more difficult, as timing is now a factor in the gameplay. What I could do is use more different movements such as circular movements and going up and down, much like Fall Guys and how it does it. This would give the game more variety in the gameplay and make it more fun for the player.        </p>
        <p><img src="../../../fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-for-pc_7mpr.jpg" width="600" height="338" alt=""/></p>
        <p>The game itself</p>
        <p>Here is a screen recording of me playing the game.</p>
        <p>https://youtu.be/rj16o_VaHP8</p>
        <p><img src="../../../SCR-20241001-lkxq.png" width="800" height="337" alt=""/></p>
        <p>The game is made up of platforms, some moving, some still. The larger platforms are the checkpoints, if you fall off, you will be sent back to the last checkpoint. The game play works mostly as intended, although it is possible to cheat and go to a future stage before completing the previous ones, but it is a much harder jump than what is in the gameplay so I will just embrace that rather than fixing it. </p>
        <p>Reflection</p>
        <p>Whilst this game was a good project to work on for developing skills, it was a little over ambitious for the allotted time (1 hour). Next time I would make something that is smaller, and maybe has a little more variety in its animations. If I was to expand on this project in the future, what I would do is add more variety of different animations, and change the textures of the platforms, and perhaps make the platforms at the bottom which kill the player invisible. I would go for something more colourful like fall guys, I feel that those bright colours would go great with the chaotic nature of what I have created.</p>
        <p>Peer Feedback</p>
        <p><img src="../../../Image (1).png" width="400" height="310" alt=""/></p>
        <p>The first bit of feedback reporting a potential bug, I can't seem to reproduce, but as soon as I see the issue I will try and fix it. The second piece of feedback I completely agree with, it is difficult, but can be made easier by using different colours/textures for the platforms. This is a change I will definitely make going forward as it is something that has worked in a game before (Fall Guys), so if done right it would look good and make the game a much better experience.</p>
        <p>Playing other games has helped me realise the importance of texturing the platforms, but it is always possible to over do it.</p>
        <p>The Island </p>
        <p>Research</p>
        <p><img src="img/SCR-20240923-ixgv.jpeg" width="409" height="287" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-ixjw.jpeg" width="235" height="294" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-iyfx.jpeg" width="219" height="286" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-iysy.jpeg" width="279" height="293" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-iyxy.jpeg" width="343" height="291" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-izgy.jpeg" width="701" height="296" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-izpz.jpeg" width="368" height="286" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-izxn.jpeg" width="439" height="293" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-jabz.jpeg" width="268" height="294" alt=""/><img src="img/SCR-20240923-jaty.jpeg" width="264" height="289" alt=""/></p>
        <p>Plan</p>
        <p>For this project, I will create a volcanic island with a small village located in the caldera. It will have many trees, and the dock will be located on the beach, which is the only beach on the island, with a walk way up to the top.<br>
        There will also be caves on this island, along with hot springs.</p>
        <p>Proposal Statement</p>
        <p>My game is a short story-based adventure game with the goal of finding the source of the severed hands that have been terrorizing the residents of the village for generations.<br>
        The player will start on the beach at the port with the boat leaving them behind. The player wins when they destroy the source of the hands deep inside the caves. There will also be a pop up on screen congratulating the player on succeeding, which will give them the option to go back to the title screen or to continue exploring the island.<br>
        <br>
          The island is volcanic, and the village named Aurax is located inside the caldera. The structures in the village are traditional Japanese style. It will also have many trees, and the ground will be grass. There will also be a hot spring on the island.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to that, there will also be the caves which are where the hands come from, the source will be deep within. The caves will be made up of volcanic rock and be dark. The player will have to hold a light source, such as a torch, to explore down there. They can get that from the village.<br>
          <br>
          The atmosphere of the game will change depending on where you are on the island. If you are in the hot springs, it will be a calm and relaxing, with just the sounds of the bubbling water. On the beach, the sound of the waves crashing up against the rocks, and seagulls can be heard, and in the main village/forest area, you can hear birds tweeting, and the occasional scuttling of the hands. Finally, in the cave, you can hear the echoes of your own footsteps and the scuttling of hands occasionally.<br>
          <br>
          The main threat in the game is the hands, they will attack the player, and if they succeed in that, then the player will die, and they will be sent back to the beginning of the game.<br>
          The research I am using for this game is my secondary research on islands, and traditional Japanese architecture. Along with my primary research which included taking pictures for some textures in the game.<br>
          <br>
          The assets that are important to my game, is a player controller, trees, rocks, the houses, and the severed hands. These are the main things I expect to need to create this game.<br>
        Lastly, the visual language of this game will use textures to create a semi-realistic environment in which a fantasy creature, the severed hands, will exist in. The lighting and fog will create a strong atmosphere, which will change depending on the area of the map.</p>
