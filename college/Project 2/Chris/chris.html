		  	<h5 class="college_h">The hostile environment of space</h5>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>Above the insulating atmosphere of the Earth, spacecraft are subjected to extremes of temperature, both hot and cold, and a significantly increased threat of radiation damage, exposure to extreme heat and cold cycling, ultrahigh vacuum, atomic oxygen, high-energy radiation, and debris impact. Radiation from various sources like Stars can cause damage to cells if unprotected.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>The space probe would need protection against all these conditions, along with some potentially unknown dangers such as other creatures. Therefore, all the dangers would affect the design of the probe as it will need shielding against radiation, and debris, along with being able to withstand the ultrahigh vacuum environment. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>Assuming that humans would also be travelling on this probe, it will need to have oxygen production and be able to regulate temperature. There will also need to be a way to produce food long term given the distance between Earth and the asteroids they may be going to, along with a way to produce fuel or to run the probe completely off solar energy.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<h5 class="college_h">Competition</h5>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>It may be an unethical practice unless it can be regulated to bring benefits to all.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>The mined minerals could be stolen and sold by other companies/Government. The level of wealth required to pursue an asteroid mining venture is concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>Competition - is when competing companies are striving to gain or win something by defeating or establishing superiority over other companies. This means that the race to find out information about asteroids could create pressure to put the person or people into a dangerous situation where someone could get hurt.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>Competition would be a major problem until space is regulated by governments. This means that probes will need to be fitted with weapons and extra shielding against attacks, along with a stealth mechanism or a way to create a decoy hologram ship. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>The only way the other issue of companies/governments stealing from each other would be to have better defenses than the other, or for there to be international laws that prevent such things happening.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>The next problem is that only the very wealthy can afford to mine on an asteroid, and there would never be a benefit to the poor, unfortunately it will remain impossible for the poor to run missions like these until costs come down with more efficient processes, which will happen with time.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
		  	</div>
		  	<h5 class="college_h">Hazards of landing and operating on the asteroid</h5>
		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>Notable asteroid mining challenges include the high cost of spaceflight, unreliable identification of asteroids which are suitable for mining, and the challenges of extracting usable material in a space environment. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

		  		<p>Asteroids are not large enough to produce significant gravity, making it difficult to land a spacecraft. The astronaut would sink into the asteroid if they land too hard. Asteroids don't have mass and size to crush together into balls like larger planets do. This means that its surface gravity is too low to be able to walk on.</p>

					<p>No Man’s Sky is a third person, open world game. The game is infinite with procedurally generated planets and a 30+ hour story.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Based on reviews, the game has great graphics and story but even 4 years after launch, a lot of reviews talk about its mundane and repetitive gameplay as there’s not so much to do after the main story of the game is complete.</p>

					<p>Osiris is a 3D futuristic Sci-fi survival game. It incorporates cinematic beautiful alien like environment with elements of horror and mystery. In the game you play as a mission specialist to build your planetary base, pilotable vehicles, and controllable drones used to explore the dangerous solar system far from earth. I believe this game is aimed at a more 17-34, as the horror aspects of the game could scare some younger players, and the exploring aspects of the game could appeal to an older audience.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The game space invaders is quite an old game, from 1978. This means that the graphics of this game are not as advanced as most other games you will see. The style of this game is quite retro, it includes enemies that can fire back at the character you’re playing, in a very basic way. This game is not 3d, or realistic, and there is very little detail or shading in the characters themselves, they are just little blocks of pixels that are shaped to give the illusion of characters. This game also looks as if it has been created for younger children, as there are many bright colours and there is no graphics that could be harmful to children. The aim of this game is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. The background is more realistic, it appears to be a solid image of outer space, not animated at all.</p>

A very large part of the game is the exploration; the travel speed is slow compared to the size of space, making it feel more real and giving a very large sense of scale for the game.</p>

		  	<div class="row">
		  		<p>After researching space related games, mine is going to combine the open world aspect of No Man’s Sky, the horror aspect of Osiris and the resource management aspect of Satisfactory. This will affect the design language of the game as with open world and resource management games, realistic graphics are not as important as in games such as Starfield, which are focused on realism. This means that my game will have a more simplistic/cartoon style of graphics, but with enough realism to accommodate the horror aspect. These space creatures will need to be terrifying. This would make the game aimed at an older audience, likely 17-35.</p>
