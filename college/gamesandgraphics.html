				<p>Here I used the Gradient Tool [G] to make the sky, using the settings that can be seen above. I then used the Rectangular Marquee Tool [M] to create the buildings and I used two separate layers with different shades of brown to create some depth with the buildings.</p>

			  <div class="column">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>To add the sun to the image, I added a circle using the Ellipse Tool [U], and then added an outer glow effect to it by double clicking on the layer, and adding the glow effect, changing the colour of it to yellow.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>While the way I chose to add the sun created the desired result for this image, it is possible to do it in another way, and that is by merging the layers [CTRL + E], whilst selecting the layers you want to merge and then using the Brush Tool [B] and using the 'Color Dodge' mode, changing the colour to an orange colour. </p>

				<p>The Magic Wand Tool [W] has been used here to remove the sky; this tool selects all similar colours in a certain area. The Tolerance is the number of different shades of colour it can select, for example, 32 would be 16 shades darker and 16 shades lighter, this is the tolerance I have used to cut out the sky in this picture.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The screenshot  shows the layer as masked; it can be done by pressing ‘Q’, this puts us into quick mask mode, from here we can use a brush (B) to add or remove from the selection by alternating between black and white [X]. This makes it easier to see what has and hasn’t been selected with the wand.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(Note: Make sure that the colours are black and white or it will not work correctly.)</p>

				<p>Then I desaturated [CTRL+SHIFT+U] the bear to make it grayscale like the rest of the image and then adjusted the brightness and contrast to make the bear appear much further away. This makes the bear look way less out of place in this image. </p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>After replacing the sky, I then adjusted the brightness, contrast, hue and saturation of the statue to make it fit in with the sky.</p>

		<h4 class="college_h">Why would you want a lower resolution image?</h4>
			<p>There are a few reasons why you would want to have a lower (or higher) resolution. The main one is file size, specifically if you are putting an image on a website, like the ones you are seeing here. High resolution images with large file sizes are not good for websites (or to send over email), as they are too big. The largest you would realistically want to put on a website is about 1MB, as you can see above, the images have a different file size, the best quality one is 24.9MB, which would use way too much bandwidth (expensive), and take a long time to load in for the user. This is bad because it costs more for the website host and possibly the end user if they are on mobile data or a limited data broadband plan (like most are in the USA).</p>

				<p>This design was already very good to begin with and could be made even better with some small changes, such as fixing the proportions. The written content was also very good but could also be made more detailed. </p>

		  	<h4 class="college_h" id="ABOUT_CHAR">About My Character</h4>
		  	<div class="row">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The race of this character is Tabaxi, more commonly known as cat folk, they are fast, have average strength and are very intelligent, this explains the cat head and paws that are visible to most. They are also 5 foot and 3 inches, making them about average for the race that they are. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>They are commonly found wearing a shirt, tie and jacket with various badges attached, such as the “A+” badge. They also have flowers in their jacket pocket, these may have a secondary purpose, but they are assumed to just be there for the aesthetics.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>They also wear cargo jeans and have plenty of pockets for storing important items such as keys and wallet. Boots are their usual footwear of choice as they are durable and comfortable for the long hours of work, they do.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>They do some sort of work in the military, but it is unknown as to what they do. Probably something important if it is that secretive.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

		  	<h4 class="college_h" id="REFINEMENT">Refinement</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The changes I made, was to remove the guns from the jacket, redraw the head to proper proportions so it looks better with the rest of the body and made the cargo jeans more rounded.</p>
